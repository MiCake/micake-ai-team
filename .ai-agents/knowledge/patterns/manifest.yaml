# Discovery guidance
discovery:
  description: |
    To discover available patterns:
    1. List subdirectories of knowledge/patterns/
    2. Each subdirectory is a pattern pack
    3. Read {pattern}/manifest.yaml for pattern details
  
  to_add_pattern: |
    1. Create knowledge/patterns/{pattern}/ directory
    2. Add manifest.yaml with pattern metadata
    3. Add pattern documentation files
    4. Register in config.yaml under pattern.available
