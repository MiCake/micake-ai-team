# Code Analysis Skill

Analyze code structure, quality, patterns, and dependencies.

## Usage

This skill is invoked by: **Architect**, **Developer**, **Reviewer**, **Tester**

## Capabilities

### Structure Analysis
- Module/namespace organization
- Class hierarchies and relationships
- File organization patterns

### Pattern Detection
- Design patterns (Repository, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Architectural patterns (Layered, DDD, Clean Architecture)
- Anti-patterns and code smells

### Quality Assessment
- Complexity metrics
- Coupling and cohesion analysis
- Best practice adherence
- Error handling patterns

### Dependency Analysis
- Internal module dependencies
- External package dependencies
- Circular dependency detection

## Execution

When invoked, perform these steps:

1. **Identify Target**: Determine files/folders to analyze
2. **Detect Tech Stack**: Identify language and framework
3. **Analyze Structure**: Map code organization
4. **Identify Patterns**: Detect design/architectural patterns
5. **Assess Quality**: Evaluate against best practices
6. **Report Findings**: Present structured analysis
