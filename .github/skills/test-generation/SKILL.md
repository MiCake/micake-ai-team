# Test Generation Skill

This skill delegates to the core agent framework implementation.

To perform test generation, you **MUST** first read and then follow the detailed instructions in:
`.ai-agents/skills/test-generation.md`

**Steps:**
1. Read the implementation file: `.ai-agents/skills/test-generation.md`
2. Execute the `Usage`, `Capabilities`, and `Execution` steps defined in that file.
